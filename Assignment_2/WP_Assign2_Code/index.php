			<p>Fortnite Battle Royale is a video game phenomenon taking the world by ‘storm’. By Epic Games, this cartoony third person shooter has attracted a wide-spread following of all skills and abilities. However, getting that victory royale ain’t easy, needing to beat the other 99 players to take the top spot. This is where we come in; we aim to help novice players become the gaming gods they were born to be, by giving them the ultimate advantage. A gun straight out of the battle bus, a head start in the race to the ultimate prize.</p>

			<p>We have seen and experienced the struggles of novice players frantically searching their surroundings only to be eliminated without finding a single weapon. Most video games come with tutorials with a helping hand that get the player use to the game. Fortnite is not one of those games. Thus, we want to supply a pesudo-tuorial.</p>
